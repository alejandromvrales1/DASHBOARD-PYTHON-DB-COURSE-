# 📊 Academic Performance Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of students containing demographic information, entry exam scores, study habits, and performance in **Python** and **Database** courses.  
The goal is to identify insights such as:  
- Performance distribution by **country**, **gender**, and **previous education**.  
- Relationship between **study hours** and academic results.  
- Comparison between **entry exam scores** and course outcomes.  

The results are visualized in an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.
